In this repository I am storing most of the programs I have written for my studies.
Some programs, usually from earlier semesters will surelly look bad and or use extensively Polish language.
I have not kept descriptions of tasks for programs and usually have not kept making documentations due to laziness.
Below are some descriptions of more interesting programs I have written:

from semester2:
-TreeServerClient - GUI client-server based applications to store and edit various tree structures.

from semester3:
-Go Game - Network based application for playing Go games. Written together with another student. 
I did most of the GUI and network code. Game logic and board part of GUI was made by partner.
-PolandGIS - Application for working with GIS databases. Allows for creation and edition of tables with PostGIS extension enabled for PostgreSQL database.
